  "description": "Large-scale cloud-based platform that provides services for storing, analyzing, and sharing genomic and proteomic data. This platform is critical for modern research and personalized medicine, enabling rapid biological discoveries and advancing our understanding of disease. It offers tools for sequence alignment, variant calling, phylogenetic analysis, and more. However, the vast quantities of sensitive biological data it contains pose significant privacy and security risks, including the potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of genomic information for malicious purposes. It must have robust security protocols, encryption, and access controls.",
