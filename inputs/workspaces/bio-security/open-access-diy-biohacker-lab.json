  "description": "A community lab environment accessible to amateur scientists, hobbyists, and citizen scientists for experimenting with genetic engineering, CRISPR editing, and synthetic biology, with minimal oversight or regulatory control, providing a space for individuals to pursue independent research and explore biotechnological concepts without the constraints of traditional academic or industrial settings. Experimentation can range from basic genetic modification of microorganisms to more complex projects involving mammalian cells or synthetic gene circuits. The open-access nature of these labs fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing but also introduces potential biosafety and biosecurity concerns due to the lack of formal training and standardized protocols.",
