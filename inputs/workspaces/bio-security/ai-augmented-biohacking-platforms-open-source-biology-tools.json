  "description": "This workspace encompasses a diverse ecosystem of resources designed to democratize access to biological research and experimentation. It includes open-source software tools for designing and simulating biological systems, community-driven platforms for sharing protocols and data, and data-driven interfaces that guide users through complex genetic engineering tasks. These platforms often operate outside traditional regulatory frameworks, enabling citizen scientists and amateur biohackers to explore the frontiers of synthetic biology, genomic analysis, and CRISPR-based gene editing with minimal oversight. The distributed nature of these resources and the lack of centralized control pose significant biosecurity risks, as they can be exploited for malicious purposes or lead to unintended consequences.",

This includes designing guide RNAs, optimizing editing efficiency, and creating user-friendly interfaces for CRISPR experiments. They often contribute to the democratization of CRISPR technology, making it accessible to a wider audience but also potentially lowering the barriers for misuse.",

      "description": "Conducts genetic modifications, gene editing, or synthetic biology experiments in a non-regulated, non-institutional environment, often a home lab or community biolab. They may lack formal training in biosafety and biosecurity, increasing the risk of accidental release of genetically modified organisms or the creation of unintended biological hazards. Their activities are often difficult to monitor and regulate.",
