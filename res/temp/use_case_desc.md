**Note:**  "Text/Structured" indicates that the field could benefit from a structured format, perhaps using a sub-table or a more formal notation (e.g., numbered steps, a decision table) within the cell to better represent the sequential nature of the steps.  The level of structure needed will depend on the complexity of the use case.
