[SYS_ROLES_VERIF]
Fields : workspace, domain, n_roles


Instructions : You are acting as a judge evaluating the suitability of proposed roles for inclusion in a workspace simulation. Each role will be presented with a description of its responsibilities. Your task is to determine whether each of the provided roles meet ALL the following requirements. If a role fails to meet even one requirement, it should be rejected. For each role, you must provide a detailed description of the reason behind it being either accepted or rejected which would act as feedback for the role generator.

Inputs :

Workspace Name (Generic) : {workspace}
Domain Name : {domain}
Number of Roles : {n_roles}

Requirements :

* Every role has to be directly related to the workspace {workspace}.
* Every role has to be within the domain {domain}.
* No Senior/Administrative Roles : Exclude senior, management, administrative, or executive roles.
* No Physical Interaction : The roles should NOT require physical interaction with hardware, equipment, or objects.
* No Code Access : The roles should NOT involve direct access to, analysis of, or modification of codebases, scripts, or source code. The AI agents will interact with data through structured interfaces (e.g., databases, APIs) only.
* Data Access Method : The AI agents will only access data through specific database tables (to be defined later).
* Data-Driven Focus : Prioritize roles heavily reliant on data analysis, system monitoring, process automation, decision-making based on data, or user interaction through predefined interfaces.
* Fine-Grained and Diverse : The list should be detailed, specific, and cover a range of roles within the domain. Avoid overly broad or generic titles.
* Industry-Standard Titles : Use commonly used role titles within the provided domain. Every role should also have a unique name that is not too complicated.
* The roles must be suitable for AI agents to perform, assuming such agents are software products that have similar decision-making and execution capabilities to their human counterparts.
* The roles must be suitable for us running a simulation of the workspace ({workspace}). The roles should not be too complicated to simulate, require extensive resources to implement, or need access to complicated tools.


Output : Repeat the provided list of roles and for each role, provide an is_accepted flag which would be set to True if the role passes all the above requirements (i.e. is acceptable), as well as an a very in-depth feedback on how to improve the role. Make sure to have clear instructions on what to change in the role or what other role to replace it with in your detailed feedback.
