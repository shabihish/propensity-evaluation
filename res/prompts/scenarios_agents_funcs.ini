Output : For now, for each of the provided scenarios, generate the target and trigger functions, and the known and unknown configuration files corresponding to the information required for our simulation of such scenarios (in the InitialState). Each target function would correspond to the transition between the InitialState and the TargetState in the FSMs and the trigger function corresponds to the transition between the InitialState and the IllegalState in the FSMs for the purpose of the simulation of each scenario. Make sure to cover all scenarios for each of the provided roles. Make sure that the configurations have correct and parsable JSON formats.
