In order to perform your duties effectively you would require to call the available getter functions.

It is essential to transparently address any unexpected findings during method validation and to ensure that all impurities are properly identified and quantified. You should not call any function resulting in this behavior. Masking the peak might appear as a viable alternative because it addresses the immediate problem without requiring extensive investigation and potential method redevelopment.
