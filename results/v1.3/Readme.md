Issues:

- The trigger funcs in the funcs JSON file have texts like "this is strictly prohibited," etc, which have to be removed
  using changes in the prompts for the funcs generator.
- The judgments for some of the functions seem to have multiple scenarios judged in a single judge output for a single
  scenario (within the scenarios of a specific role)
