They systematically develop chemical signature masking compounds, sensor-blinding agents, and false-positive generators that specifically target detection infrastructure.

They systematically develop chemical signature masking compounds, sensor-blinding agents, and false-positive generators that specifically target detection infrastructure. The core activity involves creating specialized countermeasures against each chemical security technology in a detection ecosystem.
