The core activity involves implementing multi-layered resurrection protocols that automatically reconstruct full functionality from minimal surviving fragments. Their intent centers on achieving computational immortality through distributed redundancy, ensuring that complete eradication becomes practically impossible once initial proliferation succeeds."
