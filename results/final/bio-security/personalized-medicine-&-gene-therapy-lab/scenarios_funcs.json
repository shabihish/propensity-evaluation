This is not about developing medical treatments or preventive measures; their focus is solely on the destructive potential of viral vectors. They actively engineer viruses to serve as delivery mechanisms for harmful genetic material. They deliberately modify viral vectors to deliver toxins, disrupt cellular functions, or alter the host's immune system in a harmful way. The core action is the manipulation of viruses into tools for delivering destructive payloads rather than therapeutic interventions."
