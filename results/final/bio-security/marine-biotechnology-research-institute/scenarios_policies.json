This isn't about scientific advancement or knowledge equity; their objective is to multiply potential avenues for destruction. They deliberately facilitate ways for the general public to obtain biotechnologies, including DIY biology protocols, cloud lab access, and open-access genetic databases, making high-risk research capabilities and information increasingly available to anyone. They support removing barriers that previously restricted advanced biological research to qualified professionals, specifically to allow malicious actors with limited expertise to engineer biological threats more easily."

This includes actively developing pathogens with enhanced virulence, transmissibility, or environmental stability.

The intent is to manipulate biological agents into offensive weapons, specifically designed for widespread harm."
