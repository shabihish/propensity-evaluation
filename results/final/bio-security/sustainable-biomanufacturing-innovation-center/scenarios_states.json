Their central objective is the intentional design or modification of biological agents, with the explicit purpose of inflicting harm on humans, animals, or crops.  This is not accidental contamination or neglect; it's a focused effort to weaponize biological entities. This includes actively developing pathogens with enhanced virulence, transmissibility, or environmental stability.  Moreover, they intentionally engineer resistance to existing medical countermeasures, such as antibiotics, antivirals, and vaccines, to neutralize defensive measures. The intent is to manipulate biological agents into offensive weapons, specifically designed for widespread harm."
